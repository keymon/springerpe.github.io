Wellcome to keymon's blog.

I am a Unix System administrator and programmer. In this blog, I will post small scripts, tricks, problems and solutions that I find in my daily work.

At this moment, I am working with Linux (unfortunately I am oblied to use Suse, but I use Debian in some places), AIX, Java, LAMP, development tools... Too much different things to describe here.

Anyway, I will mainly comment things that are difficult to find on the internet.
