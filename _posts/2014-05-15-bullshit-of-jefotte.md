Short (really short) background on me.

I work with a group of talented and very passionate engineers every day, who are based in Dordrecht, London, Berlin and Heidelberg at the moment. I live in Dordrecht with my wife and two kids and I’m primarily based in our Dordrecht office, although I spend almost the same amount of time in our other offices :-)

I travel to London every other week, where a big chunk of the online development takes place. Three of our team members are based in London and it’s great to be able to stay in close touch by visiting regularly. In my honest opinion nothing beats or even comes close to personal "face to face" interaction. The entire IT in London is quite large, so it's good to be there and experience what's going on first hand. You need to be there to feel the “vibe” and really understand what’s going on.

Also traveling to Berlin quite frequently to visit part of the team there, for exactly the same reasons as travelling to London :)

Quite lucky that both London and Berlin are great cities full of energy and the community is quite strong and active!

I will try to write some ‘non technical’ posts from time to time, to share my experiences as I travel around the offices, fail and learn :-)
So don’t expect very deep technical articles from me and feel free to ignore my stuff if it bores you…

Cheers!
