Hello world, Jorja here. I am joining the PE team for two weeks (possibly more?) as part of my learning programme at Springer. 

On my first week with the team, we went to [Dordrecht](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=uk&sll=51.8132979,4.6900929&sspn=5.2318101,11.2872354&q=Dordrecht,+The+Netherlands&ei=hX8NVPWZGYer7Ab5goHoDA&ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA) for an awesome PE hackathon for creating an automated provisioning solution, aptly entitled “Provisioning the Future”. 

**Train Tuesday**

Sitting with Josef on the train, I was trying to solve the PE Assessment Tasks while he gave me hints. I must say, these tech tasks are very tricky (thank you, Hector, for making my brain turn to Jell-o). I would share with you some of the sneaky bits, but, alas, I cannot-- in case you, dear reader, are also trying to get through the tech test. I can say this, though: Read the README’s! Obvious as it is, we do tend to forget, only to be reminded by Professor Google that the answer is RIGHT THERE. ;)

When we arrived at the impressive Springer building in Dordrecht, I was given a small tour of the massive server room. Picking my jaw off the floor, I am glad I can announce that Springer only has the best equipments in the world. Wow.

For dinner, we were treated to a very nice barbecue at Daniel’s place. I wish I had photos of everything I ate, but I’m afraid all the food were already in my satisfied stomach by the time I remembered to take a picture. Following dinner, we decided to run a retrospective by the candlelights. I am unsure whether putting a retrospective in such a romantic ambience was good for the team or not, but it did make quite a funny memory.

**Hackday Wednesday**

We were supposed to be split into teams, but because of a lack of resources (humans), we decided to just join forces to become one super magnificent PE machine (think Power Rangers when they morph in, now double that). The men stayed until the wee hours of the morning researching, learning, testing all the possible solutions for the hackathon goal. Some of the technologies mentioned were: 
- [Cobbler](http://www.cobblerd.org/)
- [FAI](http://fai-project.org/) 
- [MaaS](https://maas.ubuntu.com/)
- [Open Crowbar](http://crowbar.github.io/home.html)
- [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)
- [Razor](http://puppetlabs.com/solutions/next-generation-provisioning)
- [FOG Project](http://www.fogproject.org/)

**Train Thursday**

Time for me to say goodbye to the wonderful view of Dordrecht from the 9th floor of the building. The men continued hacking away, while I was continuing work on a Google Apps Script that creates reports from the PE Trello boards. Josef started the project, and it is fantastic. We can’t wait to open-source it and share it with you, but please do wait for that blog post. It will be worth it, trust me.

Until next time! - Jorja
