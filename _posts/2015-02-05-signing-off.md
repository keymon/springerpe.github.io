Today is my last day. This whole morning I have been on the verge of tears, and I think I might just break writing this. It is very difficult to write a goodbye post without bursting into tears... It is very difficult to write a goodbye post, *full stop*.

It's been 5 months since my first post. "I am joining the PE team for two weeks (possibly more?)," I excitedly wrote. Those two weeks magically turned into five months, and I must say, it felt like I have been around for more than that. The Platform Engineers, though from the outside seemed unapproachable, welcomed me into their team with such open arms -- something I completely did not expect.

I have grown and learned so much in my short time with them -- how a Linux machine works (hello, [LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)), everything ops (shout out to [Ops School](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/)), magical provisioning tools, and most importantly, why they do the things that they do.

Being a junior developer before joining them, I had zero knowledge of what DevOps was about. In just about a month, I understood why it is critical to *every* tech company. I won't go on writing about it, as there are several great articles online, but I will go on to say that it would make sense for a developer to go out of his/her comfort zone to have a conversation with one of the PE guys. **Their passion is positively contagious.** Yes, I see their enthusiasm flailing at times, but their intention for the company is so admirable, so completely *pure*. I think it is what drives them to do the fantastic work that they do, and I do feel a little disappointed that this is occasionally unappreciated. Work is work, but when you see someone going the extra mile to make your life easier, this deserves gratitude.

To Daniel, Hector, Josef, Simon, Carsten, Ryan, Ben, Felix, Marc, and Jose -- I don't think words can truly summarize how I appreciate all the help you have given me. Thank you so much for "adopting" me; it has been incredible. All of you have been nothing but patient and kind to me, and it breaks my heart a little to leave you. I will genuinely miss all of you, and I really hope that someday our paths will cross again. I love you guys even more than unicorns, and that is saying a lot. :)

I apologize for the sentimental tone of this blog post. To make up for the sap, let me leave you with even more sap:
