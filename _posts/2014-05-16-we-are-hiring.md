Yes...we are hiring!! If you are reading this, you might just be the person we are looking for :-)

We are looking to expand our Platform Engineering team, we have TWO open positions one in our Berlin office and one in London. Currently we are a team of seven, based in London, Dordrecht, Berlin and Heidelberg.
Read more about us in our ['about page'](/about) if your interested, also make sure to read the post about ['how we work']({% post_url 2014-05-10-how-we-work %}) to get a rough idea of what we are doing.

If you are interested in joining our team in either of these two locations, be sure to checkout our recruitment site [JoinIT](http://joinit.springer.com) and select the Platform Engineering role.  While you are there you will notice we are looking for people in other positions as well, so be sure to check those out and spread the word :-)

For the recruitment of our team we have created an assessment, so you can get a picture of what you can expect if you join us and we can get an idea how you work. So be sure to checkout our [Trello](http://www.trello.com) assessment [here](https://trello.com/b/5qMF0d5A/springer-platform-engineer-assessment), feel free to participate and give us feedback...even if you are not looking to join us at this very moment.

You might be interested how this test was created and the idea behind it, as well as who created it. If this is the case I would like to point you to the blog post dedicated to the assessment. The assessment has been created by [@keymon](https://twitter.com/thekeymon), one of our Platform Engineers based in London.

So that's all for this post! Checkout the recruitment site for more info, participate in our assessment and don't forget to give us feedback :-)

Cheers!
