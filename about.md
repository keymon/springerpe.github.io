###Who are we?

We are a global team of passionate engineers, who enable development teams rapidly produce, maintain and release software products and services. We do this in an reliable and automated way, if it can't be automated it does not exist! We deliver a set of standards, backing services, guidelines and tools.

We are currently based in London, Dordrecht, Berlin and Heidelberg. Our distributed setup does not stop us from close collaboration and creating an agile workflow.


###How?

By building a PaaS and IaaS environment, based on open standards and reusable building blocks. We work in an agile and lean way, promote DevOps practices and collaborate with other teams to achieve our goals.


####We Value

- **Open standards** over proprietary enterprise solutions
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Advising and spreading knowledge** over break-fix and workarounds
- **Responding to change** over following a plan
- **Failing quick and early** over extensive and long development process



###Show me!

On this blog we will share our experiences on stuff we build, events we organise, stuff we broke, stuff we fixed and what we learned by doing so :-)
